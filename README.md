  <li>The animation is played equally in both directions.</li>
  <li>Smoothness is set for all parts of the animation.</li>
  <li>For transition, the transition-property value must be specified.</li>
  <li>The animated element does not shift adjacent blocks and does not create a horizontal scroll.</li>
  <li>Whenever possible, element displacement animations are done using the transform property.</li>
</ul>
